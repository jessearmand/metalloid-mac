# Writing Metal App from scratch on the Mac

To practice building up modern metal mac app from scratch. It will progress by starting from one object, to many objects in a scene.

## Motivation

Trial and error, learning by doing.

It can be quite difficult to understand Metal without a good foundation in computer graphics programming. Although there's a lot of code samples, they can omit certain details that could only be understood once we experiment by actually writing the code step-by-step according to how we understand it.

## 3D Models

Sample 3D models are from [TurboSquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/Search/3D-Models)

Inspired by [Metal by Example](http://metalbyexample.com/modern-metal-2/).

## Why on the Mac

Easier development environment, faster feedback loop, and iOS simulator doesn't support Metal.
